# FaceFusion AI Deepfake Tool Online Ports

[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1198701940511617164?color=%23738ADB&label=Discord&style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/Xw7yc2jA9w)

As the official FaceFusion Colabs won't be supported anymore, because FaceFusion uses Paid Clouds like ThinkDiffusion & RunDiffusion, you can use those Online **Unofficial** Free Ports!



Credits: I didn't make everything alone, every port has his own credits in it, except the hugging face one because it directly launches the UI, that was made by me ([Nick088](https://linktr.ee)) and ofc the program by [Original FaceFusion team](https://github.com/facefusion/facefusion) which I'm not affiliated with (for official facefusion related issues, you should check [their discord](https://join.facefusion.io/)).

# FAQ

## Which ports do you suggest?

Depends if you want..

- **Long sessions/videos, most stable one for FREE:** [Lightning.ai](https://github.com/Nick088Official/FaceFusion-Online-Ports?tab=readme-ov-file#lightning-ai) as it has nothing against deepfakes or web uis, it's the fastest and most stable FREE port at the moment.

- **Most FREE GPU time:** [Google Colab](https://github.com/Nick088Official/FaceFusion-Online-Ports?tab=readme-ov-file#google-colab) as it gives around 120 hours per month (4 hours a day), but it's not stable as the free resources are not guaranteed, and on the free tier you could have issues as it's not allowed (but I use encryption to help this, check [this](https://github.com/Nick088Official/FaceFusion-Online-Ports?tab=readme-ov-file#google-colabs-only-is-there-still-a-chance-for-getting-banneddisconnected)).

- **Easiest to setup:** [Hugging Face Space](https://github.com/Nick088Official/FaceFusion-Online-Ports?tab=readme-ov-file#hugging-face-space) which you just need to duplicate the space, but its slower as it runs on CPU, better to use it just for images not videos.

## Are you going to help to remove the NSFW Filter? Or make a way to use FaceFusion without filter?

No as FaceFusion doesn't allow deepnudes. If you make an issue for issues/help related to removing the NSFW filter, I'm not going to help for that.

## (GOOGLE COLABS ONLY) Is there still a chance for getting banned/disconnected?

My colabs have multiple layers of obfuscation & encryption. I try everything I can for make it run the longest,

But there are still some pretty low chances of getting banned, which i had only 1 report during the whole time that I have made those colabs.

About getting disconnected for disallowed code there could be some chances as Google Colab's detection system can change per time, and it's kind of random as generally speaking in banned colabs, I seen some able to run it for 3 hours, some others for less.

My suggestions are:
- Try with different accounts
- Retry and luck
- Considerating the [lightning.ai port](https://github.com/Nick088Official/FaceFusion-Online-Ports/blob/main/README.md#lightning-ai) as a free alternative as they don't have anything against web uis & deepfakes

You can [make an issue](https://github.com/Nick088Official/FaceFusion-Online-Ports/issues/new) if the detection becomes too often.

## (GOOGLE COLAB ONLY) If i pay for pro subscription, will I be always 100% safe from being disconnected/banned?

Yes, paid colab users don't have any issues with restricted things like Web UIs and Deepfakes. However I will try to make so the chance for free tier users is low too.

## Will the Kaggle ports ever be back?

Probably not. They instant ban you when you try to download FaceFusion (yes even with encryption).
