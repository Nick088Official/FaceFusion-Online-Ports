Running these scripts using non-commercial models on Paid cloud instances (Google Colab Pro, Lightning.AI Paid Tiers, etc.) may be a violation of the model creators' licenses, as the cloud provider is profiting from the usage of those models.

    "## BASIC GUIDE:\n",
    "1. **WAIT TILL THE PERCENTAGE ENVIRONMENT LOADING BAR AT THE TOP DISAPPEARS FIRST!** Be sure that you are on Jupyter Mode via right tab, and also to be using GPU for faster speed, especially L4. Run the Install FaceFusion cell and wait until it finishes.\n",
    "2. Select which type of Tunnel you wanna use, so if the API of one of them is down, you can use the other one:\n",
    "\n",
    " A) Gradio: Select it in Tunnel, Run the Run UI cell and click the Gradio Public Link Url.\n",
    " \n",
    " B) Port Viewer: Click the + at the bottom of the right tab, click on Web Apps and install Port Viewer, run the Run UI cell, then wait for the Local URL to appear and click on Port Viewer on the right tab, Add a new port and write 7860 as the Port Number and optionally give it a name, after it's added, double click on the port name to see the UI, and to see it bigger you can click Open.\n",
    "\n",
    " C) Ngrok: Select it in Tunnel, get the Ngrok Tunnel Authtoken here: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tunnels/authtokens/new, run the Run UI cell, wait for the Local URL to appear and click on the Ngrok Tunnel Public URL which is above.\n",
    " \n",
    " D) Cloudflare: Select it in Tunnel, run the Run UI cell, wait for the Local URL to appear and click on the Cloudflare Tunnel Public URL which is above.\n",
    " \n",
    " E) LocalTunnel: Select it in Tunnel, run the Run UI cell, wait for the Local URL to appear, copy the LocalTunnel Password displayed under the public link and paste it in Tunnel Password of the LocalTunnel Tunnel Public URL which is above.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For Source select the photo of the person taken as a reference point.\n",
    "4. For Target, select the photo/video of the person whose face you want to change.\n",
    "5. **(OPTIONAL)** You can decide to activate the Frame Processors face_enhancer for better results in some cases.\n",
    "6. Under Face Recognition you can choose Many to change all Target faces or Reference to change only certain reference faces.\n",
    "7. **(OPTIONAL)** With Reference Face Distance you can choose the radius distance of the reference faces that the program will change.\n",
    "8. **(OPTIONAL)** Under Reference Analyzer Direction you can choose the radius that identifies the faces to change, from left to right or vice versa.\n",
    "9. **(OPTIONAL)** Using Face Analyzer Age you can decide whether to change the faces of only people of a certain age.\n",
    "10. **(OPTIONAL)** Through Face Analyzer Gender you can decide whether to change the faces of only people of a certain sexual gender.\n",
    "11. **(OPTIONAL)** Under Options you can select Skip Download to automatically download the output.\n",
    "12. Click Start and wait for it to give you the output, download it via the icon at the top right of the image\n",
    "13. As lightning.ai storage is persistent, it's good for not wasting time installing everytime, but if there's an update to FaceFusion, or you need to swap branches or swap from CPU to GPU (or viceversa), you need to run Delete Everything and Install FaceFusion with the new changes.\n",

    "## OFFICIAL FACEFUSION USAGE GUIDES:\n",
    "- [FaceFusion Docs](https://docs.facefusion.io/knowledgebase)\n",
    "- [FaceFusion detailed Youtube Video Playlist Tuts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMwq9QXPN0iDReOut5vKekXT4V6wGTET8)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**TIPS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the process is too slow you can speed it up at the cost of losing some quality of the output, by removing “face_enhancer” and “frame_enhancer” in the frame processors box.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the process is too slow, you can split the Target video into videos of 1 minute each, and run the process again for each video, then finally link them all together by placing them on any free editing app like Capcut.\n",
